# GameInformer Magazine

In fall of 2009, Epic Mickey was officially revealed to the world via a special issue of GameInformer magazine. The issue provided an early look into the game with various screenshots and a summary of the demo's story. Most, if not all, of the GameInformer demo's style and story was completely replaced by the time the final game was finished.

## Story

## Gameplay

### Cut Abilities

### Differences 

The paint/thinner meters were initially a single meter. The config options for this are still in the final game, but when enabled nothing changes. It is unknown how the single meter would work.  
The meter is also never seen in screenshots, so it is assumed it would appear only while you are using the brush.

Pete was planned to be a villain in the game and a comedic relief character, however the only Pete in the final game that attacks Mickey is Petetronic. Pete was also at one point called "Black Pete", but it is unknown if it was changed to simply "Pete" before or after this demo was shown.
