# GameInformer Magazine

In fall of 2009, Epic Mickey was officially revealed to the world via a special issue of GameInformer magazine. The issue provided an early look into the game with various screenshots and a summary of the demo's story. The [web page](https://www.gameinformer.com/mickey) is still available to this day, although various videos are inaccessible (but thankfully most have been archived). Most, if not all, of the GameInformer demo's style and story was completely replaced by the time the final game was finished.

## Story

### Intro/Lab

The story in the demo was quite different than the final game. After Mickey gets pulled into Wasteland by a now red-eyed Phantom Blot, he is taken to the Mad Doctor's Lab and has experiments run on him. Mickey is saved by Oswald, who gets embarrassed and promptly escapes without explaination. Mickey breaks Gremlin Gus out of his cage and  is told to help the other two gremlins in the lab escape (though the player can decide not to and  leave them behind if they want. Mickey then escapes the lab.

### Islands

Mickey goes through a path and finds himself at the floating islands of Gremlin Village. He is greeted by the head of Animatronic Donald and told to rescue gremlins to get a projector fixed. Donald also requests Mickey to find the rest of the parts to his body, and the player can choose to do so or sell the parts to Gremlin Sug for increased health. Mickey must travel through the islands which are connected by bridges (scrapper route) or cannons (hero route). After traveling through four islands, Mickey faces off with Pete in a colosseum. Pete is driving a zeppelin that resembles a dragon, and shoots enemies and other items at Mickey. Mickey must either shoot gremlins through cannons at Pete and the ship or shoot himself through it. After Pete is defeated, a comedic cutscene plays and the demo ends.

## Gameplay

### Cut Abilities

Mickey was able to use special abilities such as rolling balls of paint/thinner (like when bowling). Sketches were also available in this demo, with all of the final ones making an appearance. There is also evidence to suggest that the balloon and firework sketches were available, but this is not verifiable.

### Differences 

The paint/thinner meters were initially a single meter. The config options for this are still in the final game, but when enabled nothing changes. It is unknown how the single meter would work.  
The meter is also never seen in screenshots, so it is assumed it would appear only while you are using the brush.

Pete was planned to be a villain in the game and a comedic relief character, however the only Pete in the final game that attacks Mickey is Petetronic. Pete was also at one point called "Black Pete", but it is unknown if it was changed to simply "Pete" before or after this demo was shown.
