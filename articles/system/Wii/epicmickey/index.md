Epic Mickey had a long and interesting development with different stages of development and artstyles that were drastically different from eachother. This page will cover things that were for the final stage of development. For the other stages of development, check out their respective pages.

# Characters

## Enemies

### Pirate Pete

Pirate Pete was a variation of Pete that would have appeared in the first game. While there are no models or such of him in the files of the first game, there is an unused dialog line in the developer configuration files that he was meant to speak. Thanks to a leaked prototype of the second game, Pirate Pete's model can be seen in full.

### Dropwing

The Dropwing was a blotling variant that was able to fly and swoop in at Mickey. The enemy was likely at a very far point in development when it was scrapped as it was fully textured and had many developer configuration options. A single image exists of the enemy from an early 2010 magazine.

In the files of the second game, the source texture for the first game's Dropwing is present.

# Levels

## Missing Levels From Intro

In the (intro for the first game)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKm4sebyaDI], mutiple areas can be seen that do not appear in the final game. These areas are also seen in promotional work, and oddly, are later completely gone in the second game. This is never explained by either the game or JPS.

### Beanstalk Factory



### Wonderland



## Test Levels

Epic Mickey features a good list of levels meant for testing out features or bugs that were left over in the game. Many (*many*) more test levels exist than what is in the final game, but sadly no one has access to them. A full list of known test levels can be found in the [dev](Development/Configuration page). 

### AVA Particles



### Robs Particle Zoo



### Jeff Tses Particle Zoo



### Eve Colvin Zoo



### Jamey Test



### Jimmie AVA Test



### Common FX Zoo



### EB VillageTest

An area without lighting that contains a flat plane of grass with a single hut placed on it.

### Mickey Arcade

An untextured, dark, broken mess of a 2D level. It is assumed that this was supposed to be played at the Penny Arcade as some sort of minigame. It is likely that either the assets originally meant for the level are missing from the files or the level barely started development and got canned due to a lack of remaining time in the project.

### Building Standards

An unlit space that contains tests for the maximum height a ramp can go before not allowing Mickey to walk on it. When first entering the space, a simple camera panning cutscene plays, though it is unknown if the cutscene was just for a test or the area was meant to be an actual level in the final game.

### BT ShaderTest



### Wal-Mart White Room (Japan Only)

A fully lit boxed-in room with four white walls. Interestingly, this level only appears in the Japanese version of the game. The Japanese version was edited by Nintendo to fix bugs and add a few features, so it is likely the white room served some purpose only to Nintendo and not Disney.

# Dialog

## Tortooga Password

## Pirate Pete Door

As mentioned earlier, Pirate Pete is mentioned in unused dialog in a developer configuration file.

# UI

## Safe Area



## Hidden Level Loader

If renabled by altering some HUD files, two level loaders can be found in the game. Sadly, both do not function.

One, the dev level loader, was meant to be used in development to very quickly load levels, though it is unknown why exactly it exists because most developers seemed to just alter a config file before startup.

(insert dev level menu screenshot)

Another, the custom level loader, was meant to be used at events like E3 or public demos where people could try out the game. When enabled, it overrides the "Start Game", "Extras" and "Options" buttons with a list of levels for the user to play. The levels that are available in the menu can be altered with the developer configuration file.

(insert custom level menu screenshot)

## Hidden Icons in HUD File

Some HUD files have icons or graphics that are outside of the normal display area of the game, meaning they are hidden to most players.

## Vending Machine

An unused menu file shows a very early looking vending machine with the artstyle of earlier builds of the game. It also contains an array of icons.

(insert vending machine screenshot)

# Sketches

Two sketches remain unused in the final game and have (a very small amount of) leftovers in the game files.

## Balloon

A sketch that would have lifted Mickey into the air. A simple video demonstration that was made by a developer can be found in the files and uploaded on a [YouTube page](https://youtu.be/E_mP0JQAEyk).

## Fireworks

A sketch that would have fired fireworks at enemies and objects. A video for this sketch also exists and can be found [here](https://youtu.be/jGHVBqahJzI)
