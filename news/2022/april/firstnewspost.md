# Hello!

Welcome to the news section. So far it is pretty empty, but there should be some news to share here soon.

The vault is currently closed until it is finished, which will take a while because templates and such need to be made. It will be on a seperate subdomain (vault.cutcontent.com) and allow users to upload models, textures, and music from games. Since this is a *seperate* project, it won't be finished until **after** a strong foundation for the main Cut Content site is formed.

Here is a list of things that I still need to finish:
- Styling for various elements, such as code blocks, large line-breaking images, quotes, and plain-text excerpts
- Mobile layout
- Finalize organization
- Photo albums
- Video player
- Purchase domain
- Create a better home page that showcases recent activity on the site while also giving a description
- Create themes (*far* in the future)
